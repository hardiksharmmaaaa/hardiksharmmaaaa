ğŸ”­ I'm a second-year student at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University in New Delhi, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science. My passion lies in working with data, programming in Python, and contributing to open source projects. I have a deep interest in learning and making meaningful contributions in various ways.

ğŸ˜„ I strongly believe that data is more than just numbers; it tells compelling stories.

ğŸŒ± In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively volunteer to support the education of underrepresented and underprivileged individuals.

ğŸ’¬ Feel free to talk to me about any of these topics -> Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics.
